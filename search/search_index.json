It started as a self-hosted project, combining several open-sourced projects around home automation and private apps, such as Home Assistant, Plex and Firefly III. In the modern world, our digital footprint is vast, and it\u2019s difficult to control or contain. With the amount of data sent and received by nearly every app we use daily, huge organizations with deep pockets can leverage bits and pieces to build a frighteningly accurate picture of each user. Giving the user complete control of that information, and educating people about how it\u2019s collected, collated and wrangled, is one of the primary goals of the myMultivac project. Multivac\u2019s Name # Multivac is the name of a super-computer in several stories by Isaac Asimov. myMultivac was the name of my first home automation server, a raspberry pi running Home Assistant, inspired by these stories. I quickly learned that my little server could tell me so much more about my own habits and patterns: how often I was home, what time I woke up or went to bed, what I was listening to or watching\u2026 Smart devices can be used to track simple events that can unlock so much more about each of us.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#some-backstory","text":"myMultivac is a small personal project, designed to help me explore data in the world around us.

Perfect for sifting through dozens of WIP projects! Project Overview # Todo list apps are a dime a dozen, and I often find myself hopping from one to another, depending on the project that I\u2019m working on. Lately, I\u2019ve been using Pythonista 3 on iOS a lot for prototyping small projects while I\u2019m away from my desk. It has several really useful iOS-specific libraries that have been simple to use, but it\u2019s challenging to swap back and forth between apps to update tasks or make notes. I also use several iPad apps to take notes that allow me to use Apple\u2019s Pencil to scrawl out handwritten text and diagrams, and I generally export those to iCloud folders. They usually contain a lot of items that I jot down to follow up with, but they can easily get lost in the shuffle. It can be painful. This script will use the Share sheet within iOS, and process a text file line by line, looking for todo list items and keywords. If it finds them, it will create a new ClickUp task and iOS reminder item for each one, so I can more easily keep track of where I left off.
