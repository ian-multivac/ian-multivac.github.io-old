# What is myMultivac?

myMultivac is a personal project site.  Built around whole-life analytics, self-hosted projects, myMultivac's goals are to provide deeper insight and understanding into patterns that can be found within our digital footprints, in a secure, private way.  Visit [https://www.mymultivac.com](https://www.mymultivac.com) for more details.

## Projects

The projects hosted within this public repository are available as examples of some common practices and tasks I've undertaken to learn more about Python development and self-hosted applications.

### Reflections

A journaling and self-reflection app, simply designed for quick and easy posts.  This project was built using Django Rest Framework, and demonstrates authentication flows.

### Smartish Dots

A common coding exercise around genetic learning algorithms, Smartish Dots trains generations of dots to reach a goal.  This project is built using the Scene framework of Pythonista 3 on iOS.

### Foundation

A simple simulation game, in which a galaxy-spanning empire evolves over thousands of years.  There are several builds: 

- Unity3D
- Web: a simple browser to explore the procedurally-generated galaxy, with limited functionality
- iOS (Python): the main focus for the simulation and AI testing

### Todo List Sync

A Pythonista 3 script that parses text files and creates ClickUp tasks and iOS reminders for any flagged text.  Perfect for sifting through dozens of WIP projects!
